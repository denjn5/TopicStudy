# Topic Study Plan

## Phase I: Single-day simple study of any topic (MVP)
##### Goal: An operationalized text-exploration and visualization tool
_Features_:
1. A topic modeler that can handle "any" source texts (that have been formed into the expected format). It will produce a list of topics, of relative importance, with sentiment and context (co-located phrases related to each topic that help users understand what's being discussed). 
2. A visualizer for users that immediately highlights key topics, and allows exploration of key/subtopics. Exploration = review underlying texts.

_Data_: Fast, simple, future-ready internal structure.
* Topics: 
* Texts:
