# Text Analyzer
A series of helper functions to find topics in context, new important topics and sentences, and compare topics across texts, and visualize.

It's broken into 3 sets of classes:
* get_ classes retrieve a specific subject and format it for analysis (social, bible, etc.)
    -> dictionary of sources: { reference: text }
* ana_ classes take the texts and analyze them (topics, vector models)
    -> 
* viz_ classes show results
    -> graph database
    -> json 

Code example test
'''
var formatNumber = d3.format(",d");

var x = d3.scaleLinear();
'''

# Web Output
A web page that illustrates results
